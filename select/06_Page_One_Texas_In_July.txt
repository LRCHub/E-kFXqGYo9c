You beg for mercy when you crouch down in front of me.
Could you be any weaker. you? worthless being.
Every second you take is a waste of my time.
What else do you want? have you already killed me, dime? for dime.
I am ruthless. you spit a hard game. I don't like it.
I swear one day you will shape up coward. until then you are worthless.
